Electricity Demand Forecasting
Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electricity demand within the Kansai Electric Power (JP) jurisdiction for the year 2023. The dataset includes historical electricity demand and weather data from specific locations. The goal is to develop and evaluate predictive models to achieve the best forecasting accuracy.

Approach
Multiple forecasting models were implemented and compared:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – Captures long-term dependencies in sequential data.
SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) – Accounts for seasonality and trends in time-series forecasting.
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) – A powerful tree-based ensemble learning method.
Model Evaluation
To assess forecasting performance, we used:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Measures overall prediction accuracy.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Captures absolute differences in predictions.
Key Findings & Challenges
LSTM performed well in capturing long-term dependencies but required extensive hyperparameter tuning.
SARIMA worked well with seasonality but struggled with sudden demand fluctuations.
XGBoost handled complex feature interactions effectively and provided strong overall accuracy.
Error analysis showed that extreme weather events significantly impacted prediction accuracy.
Accuracy Improvement Strategies
Incorporating holiday effects using jpholiday.
Feature engineering with temperature variations and lagged demand values.
Experimenting with hybrid models that combine time-series and machine learning approaches.
Deployment Benefits
Optimized energy distribution – Helps in load balancing and reducing power wastage.
Cost savings – Supports efficient grid management and minimizes peak load costs.
Sustainability – Enables better integration of renewable energy sources.
